# IntroAstroSim
Simulations for Introductory Astronomy Labs

Currently includes:
- Moons of Jupiter Simulation: plots the relative positions of Jupiter's Galilean moons that can be used to measure Jupiter's mass.
- HR Diagram: includes real and simulated photometric data for students to build their own HR Diagram.
- stardata.xlsx: Data for the HR Diagram simulation.  The file is set up to allow users to easily add their own datasets.
- Spectral Classification: plots spectra of stars with known and unknown spectral types, as well as some common absorption line lables, for spectral classification.
